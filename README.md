> The [API used for board game data](https://www.boardgameatlas.com/) was shut down on 2023-08-30, so some core functionality of the app does not work. As this is a personal project and not a current priority, an alternative solution has not yet been implemented (as of 2024-01-09).

This progressive web app allows users to keep track of the board games they play, groups they play with, and record instances of playing to see statistics regarding their wins, losses, play frequency, etc. The site is very much a work in progress, but currently anyone is free to create an account and poke around to get a feel for the project's intent, UI, and the features that are functional. Lots of known bugs and undeveloped features, but I've been working on this as a side project when I noticed my board game usage skyrocket during the pandemic.
