ScoreBoard Games @ scoreboard.games

This progressive web app allows users to keep track of the board games they play, groups they play with, and record instances of playing to see statistics regarding their wins, losses, play frequency, etc. The site is very much a work in progress, but currently anyone is free to create an account and poke around to get a feel for the project's intent, UI, and the features that are functional. Lots of known bugs and undeveloped features, but I've been working on this as a side project when I noticed my board game usage skyrocket during the pandemic.
